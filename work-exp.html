            My Role as an Intern was to design pages for the magazine on a daily basis. I completely loved the work environment. It was completely fun-filled. No restrictions were there based on design works. The Senior Graphic Designers trained me on how to create images exactly for a magazine, and they did an excellent job. I know one thing for sure, I definitely would not regret working here for a full-time job if I have to. It is purely amazing.
