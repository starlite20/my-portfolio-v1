            This is a Short Horror Game Experience, developed for the Windows Platform.
        </p>    

        <p>
            The plot revolves around a son stuck in his dreams and is trying to find a way back home to his mom. You play as Alex, the son. Your mission is to survive and find a way out.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have programmed, conceptualized and designed the entire game. I utilized 3D Assets from the Unity Asset Store, and used music from Repulsive. The game has been gaining positive reviews since launch and has been played by various streamers on YouTube as well.

        <p>
            Project Learn++ : Interactive Learning Methods through Augmented Reality and Gamification is the concept of improvising the outdated education methods, to create a better and fun learning environment in such a way that it matches the mindset of the current generation, and at the same time, giving them more opportunities to explore.</p>

        <p>
            Augmented Reality creates that immersive wow factor and Gamification provides the daily motivation for the student. This will create a huge bunch of opportunities for the students to learn in the most exciting way possible. The combination of these two concepts produces a method which will result in the students coming forward to learn more, rather than students being forced to learn. This is the future of learning.

        <h3 class="subhead">IoT - Arduino</h3>
        <p>
            Sound pollution has been a major issue in this world, especially in India. The Indian drivers seem to have been using the horn as a play toy. This needs to be fixed and for this only the government can help us. But We as students can build a device to help the government succeed in this.
        </p>    

        <p>
            "Shut That Honk Up" device will count the frequency of the horn, and also store the duration of the length of the horn. These values can be retrieved through wireless communication.
        </p>

        <p>
            The government should help this initiative by making the device compulsory in every vehicle. The data stored inside the memory can be retrieved through wireless technology which should be implemented in Toll Gates. If the person has exceeded an average level of honking, then that person should be fined. Eventually, begin to honk wisely only when necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            A Device To Reduce Noise Pollution, and give you a peaceful day! :)

            In *typer (Star Typer), the user should type a paragraph, as it  is  from  the  screen  and  press enter.  The  program  will calculate the speed of the user and the number of errors by the user. The program will also generate a score and keep a track of the previous scores of each user.
        </p>

        <p>
            A special additional option in this program is that, the user can create levels as they wish. You can create your profile, edit it, play a level, log out, and oh, you can even cheat in this game!;)

        <p>
            This game was developed in 2013 as a school project. I was given the creative freedom to create something to bring awareness to the world about saving tigers. The answer I had was a video game for it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Save Tigers With Suhail is a combination of four different game styles. Save Tigers With Suhail was an exciting project for me personally.

        <h2 class="head-main">A Video Game for the Blind</h2>
        <h3 class="subhead">Game - Windows - GameMaker Engine</h3>
        <p>
            My project is based on entertaining a blind person. There are many people who are blind in this world, and for this, I present to you, A Video Game for the blind!
        </p>

        <p>
            Video Games are usually visually appealing with their gorgeous graphics, a blind cannot see these, but yet play them. Here is how... The blind can hear way better than a normal person, as they live their lives with mostly feeling things and listening to the sound. The Sound can be a huge plus point for them, and that is how this video game is going to be created.
        </p>

        <p>
            The blind will be able to mentally create a map of how the player and is moving and so on through his listening skills. Each minute detail designed by the game developer for the video game will help the blind visualize through his mind in a stunning way possible. The graphics for a blind person's video game lies in the sound effects given to it. This is how I plan to achieve this game.
